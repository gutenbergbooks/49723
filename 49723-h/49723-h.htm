<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Oliver Goldsmith</span>, the fifth child of Charles and Ann
Goldsmith, was born at Pallas, a hamlet of the parish of
Forney, county of Longford, Ireland, November 10th, 1728. His
father, the “Preacher” of the “Deserted Village,” having been
presented to the Rectory of Kilkenny-West, about the year 1730,
removed his family to Lissoy, the “Auburn” of the Poet. The
“modest mansion” is a ruin, or, by this time, has quite disappeared.
His first schoolmaster is described, by one who remembered
him, as a man “stern to view,” in whose “morning face”
the disasters of the day might be easily read. Goldsmith made
small progress under the ferule of Paddy Burns, and, after being
for some time a pupil in the diocesan school of Elphin, he
was placed with a competent teacher at Athlone, where he remained
two years. He was then transferred to the care of
Mr. Hughes, vicar of Shruel, who treated him with kindness, and
whom he always mentioned with respect and gratitude. His
eldest sister has given a specimen of her brother’s early and
ready humour. A large company of young people had assembled
in his uncle’s house, at Elphin, and Oliver, then nine years old,
was desired to dance a hornpipe, under very unfavourable circumstances,
for his figure was short and thick, and the marks of recent
small-pox were still conspicuous. A young man, who played the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x">x</a></span>
violin, compared him to Æsop dancing; but Oliver, stopping
short in the performance, immediately disabled his satirist with
a sharp <span class="locked">epigram:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Our herald hath proclaim’d this saying,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See Æsop dancing, and his monkey playing.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>On the 11th of June, 1745, he was admitted a Sizar of Trinity
College, Dublin&mdash;a fact which denoted a considerable proficiency
in classical learning; but he was unfortunate in his tutor, who
deserved, and has won, the title of “Savage;” and, perhaps, the
promise of Oliver was blighted by his severity. He neglected
his studies, and was seen “perpetually lounging about the college
gates.” We find him elected, June 15th, 1747, to an Exhibition,
on the foundation of Erasmus Smith, obtaining a premium at the
Christmas examination, and, after a delay of two years, taking his
Bachelor’s degree, February 27th, 1750. His father died in 1747,
but he found a second parent in the Rev Thomas Contarine, who
was descended from a noble ancestry in Venice, and had been a
contemporary and friend of Berkeley. The relatives of the poet
now advised him to “go into orders,” and yielding to the persuasion
of Mr. Contarine, he presented himself before the Bishop
of Elphin, and was rejected. Tradition ascribes the failure to his
uncanonical costume, and the episcopal dislike of scarlet breeches.</p>

<p>His kind friends might now, as he afterwards wrote, be perfectly
satisfied that he was undone; but they did not abandon
him. He was enabled to proceed to Edinburgh, towards the end
of 1752, where he attended the lectures of Monro and the other
Medical Professors. Scotland did not please him. “Shall I tire
you,” he wrote to a friend, “with a description of this unfruitful
country, where I must lead you over their hills all brown with
heath, or their valleys scarcely able to feed a rabbit? Man alone
seems to be the only creature who has arrived to the natural size
in this poor soil.”</p>

<p>His design of completing his studies at Leyden was nearly
frustrated by an act of generous imprudence, from which two
college friends set him free. From Leyden, in the April or May<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
of 1754, he sent a letter to Mr. Contarine, containing an account
of his journey, and some lively sketches of the “downright Hollander,”
with lank hair, laced hat, no coat, and seven waistcoats,
the lady with her portable stove, the lugubrious Harlequin, and
the domestic interior, which reminded him of a magnificent
Egyptian temple dedicated to an ox. He remained in Leyden
nearly a year, deriving small benefit from the instruction of the
Professors, who, with the exception of Gaubius, the teacher of
Chemistry, were as indolent as himself. Meanwhile, the necessaries
of life were costly, and the attractions of the gaming-table
proved to be overpowering and ruinous. At length, having
emptied his purse, and reduced his wardrobe to a single shirt,
he boldly resolved to make the tour of Europe. This characteristic
chapter of the Poet’s history is yet to be written, if his
lost letters should ever be recovered. The interesting and
copious narrative which he communicated to Dr. Radcliff is
known to have been destroyed by fire.</p>

<p>He commenced his travels about February, 1755. “A good
voice,” adopting his own account of an earlier adventurer, “and
a trifling skill in music, were the only finances he had to support
an undertaking so extensive.” Thus he journeyed, and at night
sang at the doors of peasants’ houses, to get himself a lodging.
Once or twice, he “attempted to play to people of fashion,” but
they despised his performance, and never rewarded him even
with a trifle. We are told by Bishop Percy, that he reached
Padua, and visited all the northern parts of Italy, returning, on
foot, through France, and landing at Dover, about the beginning
of the war, in 1756. We may believe his own assurance, that
he fought his way homewards, examining mankind with near eyes,
and seeing both sides of the picture.</p>

<p>He appeared in London, without means or interest. England,
he complained, was a country, where being born an Irishman
was sufficient to keep a man unemployed. With much difficulty
he obtained the situation of usher at a school. Johnson did not
remember the occupation with a fiercer disgust; and the redolent
French teacher, papering his curls at night, was a frequent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>
spectre of his memory. A migration from the school-room to the
chemist’s shop slightly improved his condition. Better days were
coming. By the aid of an Edinburgh acquaintance, Dr. Sleigh,
and other friends, he was “set up” as a practitioner at Bankside,
Southwark, where, in his pleasant confession, he got plenty of
patients, but no fees. A physician, Dr. Farr, who had known
him in Scotland, thus describes his appearance:&mdash;“He called
upon me one morning, before I was up, and, on entering the
room, I recognized my old acquaintance, dressed in a rusty, full-trimmed
black suit, with his pockets full of papers, which instantly
reminded me of the poet in Garrick’s farce of ‘Lethe.’
On this occasion he read portions of a ‘Tragedy,’ and talked
of a journey to decipher the inscriptions on the Written Mountains.”
In later days, when writing an “Essay on the advantages
to be derived from sending a judicious traveller into Asia,”
Goldsmith professed to feel the difficulty of choosing a proper
person for such an enterprise, and indicated the qualifications
demanded:&mdash;“He should be a man of a philosophical turn, one
apt to deduce consequences of general utility from particular
occurrences&mdash;neither swollen with pride, nor hardened by prejudice&mdash;neither
wedded to one particular system, nor instructed
only in one particular science&mdash;neither wholly a botanist, nor
wholly an antiquarian; his mind should be tinctured with miscellaneous
knowledge, and his manners humanized by an intercourse
with men. He should be, in some measure, an enthusiast to
the design; fond of travelling, from a rapid imagination and an
innate love of change; furnished with a body capable of sustaining
every fatigue, and a heart not easily terrified at danger.”</p>

<p>With the year 1757, the prospects of Goldsmith brightened,
and the papers which filled the pockets of the rusty black coat
began to get abroad. He wrote several articles for the “Monthly
Review,” translated the “Mémoires d’un Protestant,” and composed
his “Enquiry into the Present State of Polite Learning
in Europe.” The object of the work was special. He had obtained
the appointment of physician to a factory on the coast
of Coromandel, and was providing funds for the voyage. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span>
considerable sum was needed. The Company’s warrant cost ten
pounds, and the passage and equipment required one hundred
and thirty pounds in addition; but the emoluments were expected
to be large. The salary was one hundred pounds; the
average returns of the general practice amounted to a thousand;
there was an opening for commercial enterprise, and invested
money brought twenty per cent. These were flattering inducements;
but time deadened their charm, and he shrank from so
distant a banishment, and beginning life again at the age of
thirty-one. Eight years of anxiety and trial had done their work
on his face and temper. His picture of himself was most discouraging.
He had “contracted a hesitating, disagreeable manner
of speaking, and a visage that looked ill-nature itself.” Home
news deepened his melancholy, for his mother was almost blind.</p>

<p>The “Enquiry” appeared, without the Author’s name, April,
1759&mdash;a small volume, price half-a-crown; and in the autumn
of the same year, the commencement of a weekly paper, called
“The Bee,” afforded him an opportunity of showing his skill as
an Editor. His plan was to “rove from flower to flower, with
seeming inattention, but concealed choice, expatiate over all the
beauties of the season, and make his industry his amusement.”
The “Bee” expired with its eighth number, but he was more
successful in his next enterprise. To the “Public Ledger,” of
which the first number appeared January 12th, 1760, Goldsmith
contributed one hundred and twenty-three letters, which were
afterwards collected as the “Citizen of the World.”</p>

<p>The last day of May, 1761, was memorable in his life, as witnessing
the commencement of his intimacy with Johnson. His
miscellaneous productions in 1762&ndash;4 included a “Life of Richard
Nash, of Bath,” an “Introduction to Natural History,” an “Abridgment
of Plutarch,” a “History of England,” and the “Traveller.”
For the poem he received only twenty guineas, but the applause
of its readers was loud and unanimous. “I was glad,” said Sir
Joshua, “to hear Sir Charles Fox say it was one of the finest
poems in the English language.” A fourth edition was required
within eight months, and the Author lived to see the ninth. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span>
1764, he wrote the “Captivity,” for which the sum of ten guineas
was paid by Dodsley.</p>

<p>Poetry kept him poor, and we still see him writing for bread
in a garret, and expecting to be “dunned for a milk score.”
However, he cleared and warmed the future with the hopefulness
of his genial nature, and comforted himself by the recollection
that while Addison wrote the “Campaign” in a third storey, he
had only got to the second. Reckless improvidence multiplied
his difficulties. “Those who knew him,” he told a correspondent,
“knew his principles to differ from those of the rest of mankind,
and while none regarded the interest of his friend more, none
regarded his own less.”</p>

<p>Among his disappointments, at this period, are to be numbered
an unsuccessful application for a Gresham Lectureship,
and Garrick’s refusal of the “Good-Natured Man.” But Colman
put the drama on the stage, January 29th, 1768, and the Professorship
of Ancient History in the Royal Academy was agreeably
bestowed. His “Roman History,” published in 1769, was
received with favour; and in the May of 1770, the “Deserted
Village” appeared.</p>

<p>In that year, Gray travelled through a part of England and
South Wales, and Mr. Norton Nichols was with him at Malvern
when he received the new poem, which he desired his friend to
read to him. He listened with fixed attention, and soon exclaimed,
“This man is a Poet.” In twelve days the poem was
reprinted, and before the 5th of August the public admiration
exhausted a fifth impression. His comedy, the “Mistakes of a
Night” (represented March 15th, 1773), obtained a success, of its
kind, not inferior. Johnson said that it answered the great end
of a comedy&mdash;“making an audience merry.” For an impertinent
letter in the “London Packet,” Goldsmith caned the editor;
having found, was the remark of a friend, a new pleasure, for he
believed that it was the “first time he had beat,” though “he may
have been beaten before.”</p>

<p>I may add, that the Ballad of “Edwin and Angelina,” having
been privately printed for the amusement of the Countess of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv">xv</a></span>
Northumberland, was inserted in the “Vicar of Wakefield,” when
that charming fiction first came out, March 27th, 1766, to delight
the young by its adventures, and the old by its wisdom. For
two years the manuscript had lain in the desk of the Publisher,
until the fame of the “Traveller” encouraged him to send it to the
press.</p>

<p>He was now engaged in the compilation of the “History of
the Earth and Animated Nature,” for which he was to receive
eight hundred guineas; and about this time, according to Percy,
he wrote “the ‘Haunch of Venison,’ ‘Retaliation,’ and some
other little sportive sallies, which were not printed until after his
death.” Mr. Peter Cunningham<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> has, for the first time, related
the true story of “Retaliation,” in the original words of Garrick:&mdash;A
party of friends, at the St. James’s Coffee House, were diverting
themselves with the peculiar oddities of Goldsmith, who insisted
upon trying his epigrammatic powers with Garrick. Each was to
write the other’s epitaph. Garrick immediately spoke the following
<span class="locked">lines:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Here lies Nolly Goldsmith, for shortness call’d Noll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who wrote like an angel, and talk’d like poor Poll.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">The company laughed, and Goldsmith grew serious; he went to
work, and some weeks after produced “Retaliation,” which was
not written in anger, but with the utmost good humour.</p>

<p>His path seemed now to be winding out of gloom into the
full sunlight,&mdash;but, of a sudden, there rose up in it the “Shadow
feared of man.” He was busy with projects, and had prepared
a “Prospectus of an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Science,”
when a complaint, from which he had previously suffered, returned
with extreme severity. His unskilful treatment of the disorder was
aggravated by the agitation of his mind, and he gradually sank,
until Monday, April 4th, 1774, when death released him, in the
forty-sixth year of his age. His remains were interred in the
burial-ground of the Temple; Nollekens carved his profile in
marble, and Johnson wrote a Latin inscription for the monument,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi">xvi</a></span>
which was erected in the south transept of Westminster Abbey.
The epitaph is thus given in <span class="locked">English:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="p2 center vspace gesperrt wspace">
OF OLIVER <span class="locked">GOLDSMITH&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="center b2"><span class="smcap">Poet, Naturalist, and Historian,<br />
who left scarcely any style of writing<br />
untouched,<br />
and touched nothing that he did not adorn;<br />

a powerful yet gentle master;<br />

</p>

<p>Goldsmith, in the judgment of a friendly, but severe observer,
always seemed to do best that which he was doing. Does he
write History? He tells shortly, and with a pleasing simplicity
of narrative, all that we want to know. Does he write Essays?
He clothes familiar wisdom with an easy and elegant diction, of
which the real difficulty is only known by those who seek to
obtain it. Does he write the story of Animated Nature? He
makes it “amusing as a Persian tale.” Does he write a Novel?
Dr. Primrose sits in our chimney-corner to celebrate his biographer.
Does he write Comedy? Laughter “holds both its
sides” at the Incendiary Letter to “Muster Croaker.” Does he
write Poetry? The big tears on the rugged face of Johnson<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii">xvii</a></span>
bear witness to its tenderness, dignity, and truth. The naturalness
of the Author pervaded the Man. Whose vanity was so transparent,
and yet so harmless? He honestly believed himself qualified
to explore Asia, and would have undertaken to read, at sight,
the Manuscripts of Mount Athos. His tailor’s bill is a commentary
on his life. But under the bloom-coloured coat beat the large
heart of a kindly and generous nature, throwing up the spontaneous
and abundant fruitfulness of charity to the needy, and
sympathy with all. Thieves had only to plunder a stranger, to
make him a neighbour. In reading Goldsmith, or reading of him,
the touch of nature changes us into his kindred, and we do not
more admire the Writer, than we love the Brother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="in6">I am sensible that the friendship between us can acquire no
new force from the ceremonies of a dedication; and perhaps it demands an
excuse thus to prefix your name to my attempts, which you decline giving
with your own. But as a part of this poem was formerly written to you
from Switzerland, the whole can now, with propriety, be only inscribed
to you. It will also throw a light upon many parts of it, when the reader
understands that it is addressed to a man who, despising fame and fortune,
has retired early to happiness and obscurity with an income of forty pounds
a year.</p>

<p>I now perceive, my dear brother, the wisdom of your humble choice.
You have entered upon a sacred office, where the harvest is great, and the
labourers are but few; while you have left the field of ambition, where the
labourers are many, and the harvest not worth carrying away. But of all
kinds of ambition&mdash;what from the refinement of the times, from different
systems of criticism, and from the divisions of party&mdash;that which pursues
poetical fame is the wildest.</p>

<p>Poetry makes a principal amusement among unpolished nations; but in
a country verging to the extremes of refinement, Painting and Music come
in for a share. As these offer the feeble mind a less laborious entertainment,
they at first rival Poetry, and at length supplant her: they engross all
that favour once shown to her; and, though but younger sisters, seize upon
the elder’s birthright.</p>

<p>Yet, however this art may be neglected by the powerful, it is still in
greater danger from the mistaken efforts of the learned to improve it. What<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
criticisms have we not heard of late in favour of blank verse and pindaric
odes, choruses, anapests, and iambics, alliterative care and happy negligence!
Every absurdity has now a champion to defend it; and as he is
generally much in the wrong, so he has always much to say&mdash;for error is
ever talkative.</p>

<p>But there is an enemy to this art still more dangerous; I mean party.
Party entirely distorts the judgment and destroys the taste. When the mind
is once infected with this disease, it can only find pleasure in what contributes
to increase the distemper. Like the tiger, that seldom desists from
pursuing man after having once preyed upon human flesh, the reader who
has once gratified his appetite with calumny, makes ever after the most agreeable
feast upon murdered reputation. Such readers generally admire some
half-witted thing, who wants to be thought a bold man, having lost the
character of a wise one. Him they dignify with the name of poet: his
tawdry lampoons are called satires; his turbulence is said to be force, and
his frenzy fire.</p>

<p>What reception a poem may find, which has neither abuse, party, nor
blank verse to support it, I cannot tell; nor am I solicitous to know. My
aims are right. Without espousing the cause of any party, I have attempted
to moderate the rage of all. I have endeavoured to show that there may be
equal happiness in states that are differently governed from our own; that
every state has a particular principle of happiness; and that this principle in
each may be carried to a mischievous excess. There are few can judge better
than yourself how far these positions are illustrated in this poem.</p>

<p class="sigright vspace">
<span class="l4">I am, dear Sir,</span><br />
<span class="l2">Your most affectionate brother,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Oliver Goldsmith</span>.

<h3 class="newpage vspace notbold"><span class="gesperrt">DEDICATION.</span><br />

<span class="subhead wspace">TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="in6">I can have no expectation, in an address of this kind, either
to add to your reputation or to establish my own. You can gain nothing
from my admiration, as I am ignorant of that art in which you are said
to excel; and I may lose much by the severity of your judgment, as few
have a juster taste in poetry than you. Setting interest therefore aside,
to which I never paid much attention, I must be indulged at present in
following my affections. The only dedication I ever made was to my
brother, because I loved him better than most other men. He is since
dead. Permit me to inscribe this poem to you.</p>

<p>How far you may be pleased with the versification and mere mechanical
parts of this attempt, I do not pretend to inquire: but I know you will
object&mdash;and indeed several of our best and wisest friends concur in the
opinion&mdash;that the depopulation it deplores is nowhere to be seen, and the
disorders it laments are only to be found in the poet’s own imagination.
To this I can scarce make any other answer, than that I sincerely believe
what I have written; that I have taken all possible pains in my country
excursions, for these four or five years past, to be certain of what I allege;
and that all my views and inquiries have led me to believe those miseries
real, which I here attempt to display. But this is not the place to enter
into an inquiry, whether the country be depopulating or not; the discussion
would take up much room, and I should prove myself, at best, but an indifferent
politician to tire the reader with a long preface, when I want his
unfatigued attention to a long poem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
In regretting the depopulation of the country, I inveigh against the
increase of our luxuries; and here also I expect the shout of modern politicians
against me. For twenty or thirty years past, it has been the fashion
to consider luxury as one of the greatest national advantages, and all the
wisdom of antiquity, in that particular, as erroneous. Still, however, I must
remain a professed ancient on that head, and continue to think those luxuries
prejudicial to states, by which so many vices are introduced, and so many
kingdoms have been undone. Indeed, so much has been poured out of late
on the other side of the question, that, merely for the sake of novelty and
variety, one would sometimes wish to be in the right.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l8">I am, dear Sir,</span><br />
<span class="l2">Your sincere friend and ardent admirer,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Oliver Goldsmith</span>.

  <span class="subhead">A BALLAD</span></p></div></div>
</div>

<p>[A correspondent of the <i>St. James’s Chronicle</i> having accused Goldsmith of imitating
a ballad by Percy, he addressed the following letter to the Editor. In a later edition
of the “Reliques,” Percy vindicated his friend from the charge, and said, “If there is
any imitation in the case, they will be found both to be indebted to the beautiful old
ballad, ‘Gentle Herdsman,’ which the Doctor had much admired in manuscript, and has
finely improved.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;A correspondent of yours accuses me of having taken a ballad, I published some
time ago, from one (the “Friar of Orders Gray”) by the ingenious Mr. Percy. I do not
think there is any great resemblance between the two pieces in question. If there be
any, his ballad is taken from mine. I read it to Mr. Percy, some years ago; and he (as
we both considered these things as trifles at best) told me, with his usual good humour,
the next time I saw him, that he had taken my plan to form the fragments of Shakspere
into a ballad of his own. He then read me his little cento, if I may so call it, and I highly
approved it. Such petty anecdotes as these are scarce worth printing; and, were it not
for the busy disposition of some of your correspondents, the public should never have
known that he owes me the hint of his ballad, or that I am obliged to his friendship
and learning for communications of a much more important nature.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l8">I am, Sir, yours, &amp;c.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Oliver Goldsmith.</span>]

  <span class="subhead">AN EPISTLE TO LORD CLARE.</span></p></div></div>
</div>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thanks, my lord, for your venison, for finer or fatter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ne’er rang’d in a forest, or smok’d in a platter:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The haunch was a picture for painters to <span class="locked">study&mdash;</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fat was so white, and the lean was so ruddy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though my stomach was sharp, I could scarce help regretting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To spoil such a delicate picture by eating:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had thoughts in my chamber to place it in view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be shown to my friends as a piece of <i>virtù</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in some Irish houses, where things are so-so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One gammon of bacon hangs up for a <span class="locked">show;&mdash;</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, for eating a rasher of what they take pride in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They’d as soon think of eating the pan it is fried in.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
<span class="i0">But hold&mdash;let me pause&mdash;Don’t I hear you pronounce<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This tale of the bacon a damnable bounce?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, suppose it a bounce&mdash;sure a poet may try,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By a bounce now and then, to get courage to fly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, my lord, it’s no bounce: I protest in my turn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It’s a truth&mdash;and your lordship may ask Mr. Byrne.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">To go on with my tale&mdash;as I gaz’d on the Haunch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought of a friend that was trusty and <span class="locked">staunch&mdash;</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I cut it, and sent it to Reynolds undrest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To paint it, or eat it, just as he lik’d best.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the neck and the breast I had next to dispose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas a neck and a breast that might rival Monroe’s<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in parting with these I was puzzled again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the how, and the who, and the where, and the when:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There’s Coley,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> and Williams, and H&mdash;&mdash;rth, and <span class="locked">Hiff&mdash;</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think they love ven’son&mdash;I know they love beef;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There’s my countryman, Higgins&mdash;Oh! let him alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For making a blunder, or picking a bone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, hang it&mdash;to poets, who seldom can eat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your very good mutton ’s a very good treat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such dainties to them, their health it might hurt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It’s like sending them ruffles, when wanting a shirt.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While thus I debated, in reverie centred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An acquaintance, a friend as he call’d himself, enter’d;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An under-bred, fine-spoken fellow was he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he smil’d as he look’d at the venison and me.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
<span class="iq">“What have we got here?&mdash;Why, this is good eating!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your own, I suppose&mdash;or is it in waiting?”<br /></span>
<span class="iq">“Why, whose should it be, sir?” cried I, with a flounce;<br /></span>
<span class="iq">“I get these things often”&mdash;but that was a bounce:<br /></span>
<span class="iq">“Some lords, my acquaintance, that settle the nation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are pleas’d to be kind&mdash;but I hate ostentation.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">“If that be the case, then,” cried he, very gay,<br /></span>
<span class="iq">“I’m glad I have taken this house in my way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-morrow you take a poor dinner with me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No words&mdash;I insist on’t&mdash;precisely at three.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We’ll have Johnson, and Burke; all the wits will be there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My acquaintance is slight, or I’d ask my Lord Clare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now that I think on’t, as I am a sinner!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We wanted this venison to make out the dinner.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What say you?&mdash;a pasty?&mdash;it shall, and it must;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my wife, little Kitty, is famous for crust.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, porter!&mdash;this venison with me to Mile End;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No stirring, I beg&mdash;my dear friend&mdash;my dear friend!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus snatching his hat, he brush’d off like the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the porter and eatables follow’d behind.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Left alone to reflect, having emptied my shelf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And “nobody with me at sea but myself;”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though I could not help thinking my gentleman hasty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet Johnson, and Burke, and a good venison pasty,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
<span class="i0">Were things that I never dislik’d in my <span class="locked">life&mdash;</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though clogg’d with a coxcomb, and Kitty his wife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So next day, in due splendour to make my approach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I drove to his door in my own hackney-coach.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">When come to the place where we all were to dine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(A chair-lumber’d closet, just twelve feet <span class="locked">by nine)&mdash;</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My friend bade me welcome, but struck me quite dumb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tidings that Johnson and Burke would not come;<br /></span>
<span class="iq">“For I knew it,” he cried, “both eternally fail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The one with his speeches, and t’ other with Thrale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But no matter, I’ll warrant we’ll make up the party<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With two full as clever, and ten times as hearty.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The one is a Scotchman, the other a Jew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They&nbsp;’re both of them merry, and authors, like you;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The one writes the <i>Snarler</i>, the other the <i>Scourge</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some think he writes <i>Cinna</i>&mdash;he owns to <i>Panurge</i>.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While thus he describ’d them by trade and by name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They enter’d, and dinner was serv’d as they came.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">At the top a fried liver and bacon were seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the bottom was tripe, in a swinging tureen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the sides there was spinach and pudding made hot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the middle a place where the pasty&mdash;was not.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, my lord, as for tripe, it’s my utter aversion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And your bacon I hate like a Turk or a Persian;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So there I sat stuck like a horse in a pound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the bacon and liver went merrily round.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
<span class="i0">But what vex’d me most was that d&mdash;d Scottish rogue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his long-winded speeches, his smiles, and his brogue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, “Madam,” quoth he, “may this bit be my poison,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A prettier dinner I never set eyes on:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pray a slice of your liver, though may I be curst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I’ve eat of your tripe till I’m ready to burst.”<br /></span>
<span class="iq">“The tripe,” quoth the Jew, “if the truth I may speak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could dine on this tripe seven days in a week;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I like these here dinners so pretty and <span class="locked">small&mdash;</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But your friend there, the Doctor, eats nothing at all.”<br /></span>
<span class="iq">“Oh, oh!” quoth my friend, “he’ll come on in a <span class="locked">trice&mdash;</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’s keeping a corner for something that’s nice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There’s a Pasty”&mdash;“A Pasty!” repeated the Jew;<br /></span>
<span class="iq">“I don’t care if I keep a corner for ’t too.”<br /></span>
<span class="iq">“What the De’il, mon, a Pasty!” re-echoed the Scot;<br /></span>
<span class="iq">“Though splitting, I’ll still keep a corner for that.”<br /></span>
<span class="iq">“We’ll all keep a corner,” the lady cried out;<br /></span>
<span class="iq">“We’ll all keep a corner,” was echo’d about.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While thus we resolv’d, and the Pasty delay’d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With looks that quite petrified, enter’d the maid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A visage so sad, and so pale with affright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wak’d Priam, in drawing his curtains by night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But we quickly found out&mdash;for who could mistake her?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That she came with some terrible news from the baker:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so it fell out; for that negligent sloven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had shut out the Pasty on shutting his oven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sad Philomel thus&mdash;but let similes <span class="locked">drop&mdash;</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now that I think on’t, the story may stop.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
<span class="i0">To be plain, my good lord, it’s but labour misplac’d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To send such good verses to one of your taste.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You’ve got an odd something&mdash;a kind of <span class="locked">discerning&mdash;</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A relish&mdash;a taste&mdash;sicken’d over by learning;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At least, it’s your temper, as very well known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That you think very slightly of all that’s your own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, perhaps, in your habits of thinking amiss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You may make a mistake, and think slightly of this.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Each guest brought his dish, and the feast was united;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If our landlord supplies us with beef, and with fish,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let each guest bring himself&mdash;and he brings the best dish;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our Dean<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> shall be venison, just fresh from the plains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our Burke<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> shall be tongue, with a garnish of brains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our Will<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> shall be wild-fowl, of excellent flavour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Dick<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> with his pepper shall heighten their savour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our Cumberland’s<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> sweet-bread its place shall obtain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Douglas<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> is pudding, substantial and plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our Garrick’s<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> a salad, for in him we see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oil, vinegar, sugar, and saltness agree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make out the dinner, full certain I am<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Ridge<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> is anchovy, and Reynolds<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> is lamb;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Hickey’s<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> a capon, and, by the same rule,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">At a dinner so various, at such a repast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who’d not be a glutton, and stick to the last?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, waiter, more wine, let me sit while I’m able,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till all my companions sink under the table;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, with chaos and blunders encircling my head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me ponder, and tell what I think of the dead.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Here lies the good Dean, re-united to earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who mix’d reason with pleasure, and wisdom with mirth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he had any faults, he has left us in <span class="locked">doubt&mdash;</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">At least, in six weeks I could not find them out;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet some have declar’d, and it can’t be denied them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sly-boots was cursedly cunning to hide them.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Here lies our good Edmund, whose genius was such,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We scarcely can praise it, or blame it too much;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, born for the universe, narrow’d his mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to party gave up what was meant for mankind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though fraught with all learning, yet straining his throat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To persuade Tommy Townshend<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> to lend him a vote;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, too deep for his hearers, still went on refining,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thought of convincing, while they thought of dining:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though equal to all things, for all things unfit:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too nice for a statesman, too proud for a wit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a patriot too cool; for a drudge disobedient;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And too fond of the <i>right</i>, to pursue the <i>expedient</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In short, ’twas his fate, unemploy’d, or in place, sir,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To eat mutton cold, and cut blocks with a razor.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span></div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">His conduct still right, with his argument wrong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still aiming at honour, yet fearing to <span class="locked">roam&mdash;</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The coachman was tipsy, the chariot drove home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would you ask for his merits? alas! he had none;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What was good was spontaneous, his faults were his own.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What spirits were his! what wit and what whim!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now breaking a jest&mdash;and now breaking a limb;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now wrangling and grumbling to keep up the ball;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now teasing and vexing&mdash;yet laughing at all!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In short, so provoking a devil was Dick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That we wish’d him full ten times a day at Old Nick;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As often we wish’d to have Dick back again.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A flattering painter, who made it his care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To draw men as they ought to be, not as they are.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His gallants are all faultless, his women divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And comedy wonders at being so fine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a tragedy queen he has dizen’d her out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or rather like tragedy giving a rout.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
<span class="i0">His fools have their follies so lost in a crowd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of virtues and feelings, that folly grows proud;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And coxcombs, alike in their failings alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adopting his portraits, are pleas’d with their own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, where has our poet this malady caught?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or wherefore his characters thus without fault?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, was it that mainly directing his view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find out men’s virtues, and finding them few,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quite sick of pursuing each troublesome elf,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">An abridgment of all that was pleasant in man:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As an actor, confess’d without rival to shine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a wit, if not first, in the very first line;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, with talents like these, and an excellent heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man had his failings&mdash;a dupe to his art.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like an ill-judging beauty, his colours he spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beplaster’d with rouge his own natural red.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the stage he was natural, simple, affecting;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas only that when he was off he was acting.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With no reason on earth to go out of his way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He turn’d and he varied full ten times a day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though secure of our hearts, yet confoundedly sick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If they were not his own by finessing and trick:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cast off his friends, as a huntsman his pack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he knew when he pleas’d he could whistle them back.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of praise a mere glutton, he swallow’d what came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the puff of a dunce he mistook it for fame;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who pepper’d the highest was surest to please.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">While he was be-Roscius’d, and you were be-prais’d!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But peace to his spirit, wherever it flies,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With bunches of fennel and nosegays before ’em;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When uncover’d, a buzz of inquiry runs round:<br /></span>
<span class="iq">“Pray what are their crimes?” “They’ve been pilfering found.”<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Two handsomer culprits I never set eyes on!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then their friends all come round me, with cringing and leering,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To melt me to pity, and soften my swearing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First, Sir Charlès advances, with phrases well strung:<br /></span>
<span class="iq">“Consider, dear Doctor, the girls are but young.”<br /></span>
<span class="iq">“The younger the worse,” I return him again;<br /></span>
<span class="iq">“It shows that their habits are all dyed in grain.”<br /></span>
<span class="iq">“But then they&nbsp;’re so handsome; one’s bosom it grieves.”<br /></span>
<span class="iq">“What signifies handsome, when people are thieves?”<br /></span>
<span class="iq">“But where is your justice? their cases are hard.”<br /></span>
<span class="iq">“What signifies justice? I want the reward.<br /></span>
